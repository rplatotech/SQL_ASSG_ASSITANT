# SQL_ASSIGNMENT_ASSISTANT
This is an automated tool made to help review faster and better!

Welcome!

- This is just a **tool** to assist SQL assignment review **not replace** human judgment!

What does this Assistant do?
- This python code, interacts with MySQL and the corresponding DB, executes the queries sent by students and validates them by comparing the output tables.

Reasons for automating this - 
- As a problem solver and a python enthusiast, I saw an opprtunity to learn by doing stuff!
- Since the Database in this assgn. is the same and the resulting output tables remain the same for every assignment, this route of automating the assignment checks seemed right
- Although seems unreasonable, this tool is not for replacing human judgement but to assist!


How to use this - 
- Have python >3.10 installed and run the command, pip install requirements.txt to install project dependancies.
- Run test_sql_assignment-2-3-4.py

Reachout to me if you need to use this for yourself.
